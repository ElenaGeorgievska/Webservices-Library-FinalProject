						<p>As you navigate through this site, certain anonymous
							information can be passively collected (that is, gathered without
							your actively providing the information) using various
							technologies, such as cookies, Internet tags or web beacons, and
							navigational data collection (log files, server logs,

							this site some of this anonymous information, such as the URL of
							the web site you just came from and the Internet Protocol (IP)
							address and the browser version your computer is currently using.
							This site may also collect anonymous information from your
							computer through cookies and Internet tags or web beacons. You
							may set your browser to notify you when a cookie is sent or to
							refuse cookies altogether, but certain features of this site may
							not work without cookies.</p>
						<p>We use marketing consultants to help us maintain and
							analyze our data and allow us to market more efficiently. They
							may use cookies or web beacons to collect information about you,
							in connection with providing you information via email, Internet
							ads or direct mail about products and services that might be of
							interest to you. You can choose not to have this information used
							by our trusted third party advertising partners by contacting us
							to opt out.</p>
